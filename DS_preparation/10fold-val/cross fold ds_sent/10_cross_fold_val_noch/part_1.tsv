539	Imatinib mesylate (@COMPOUND$) is a potent and selective inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases, @PROTEIN$-Abl, c-Kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs).	1
540	@COMPOUND$ (imatinib) is a potent and selective inhibitor of the tyrosine kinases, Bcr-@PROTEIN$, c-Kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs).	1
541	The data provide the first demonstration for the presence of @PROTEIN$ in primary cilia of renal epithelial cells, and a functional @COMPOUND$-signaling pathway, which targets ciliary channel function and may help control the sensory function of the primary cilium.	0
542	The potentiated effect of obestatin on @COMPOUND$-induced @PROTEIN$ output was not observed in the presence of diazoxide, an agent that activates ATP-dependent K(+) channels, thus suggesting that these channels might be sensitive to this peptide.	1
543	The potentiated effect of @PROTEIN$ on @COMPOUND$-induced insulin output was not observed in the presence of diazoxide, an agent that activates ATP-dependent K(+) channels, thus suggesting that these channels might be sensitive to this peptide.	1
544	The potentiated effect of obestatin on glucose-induced @PROTEIN$ output was not observed in the presence of @COMPOUND$, an agent that activates ATP-dependent K(+) channels, thus suggesting that these channels might be sensitive to this peptide.	1
545	The potentiated effect of @PROTEIN$ on glucose-induced insulin output was not observed in the presence of @COMPOUND$, an agent that activates ATP-dependent K(+) channels, thus suggesting that these channels might be sensitive to this peptide.	1
546	Here, we report the purification, partial primary structure, carbohydrate affinity characterization, crystallization, and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of a @COMPOUND$-specific @PROTEIN$ from Cymbosema roseum seeds (CRLII).	1
547	To test this hypothesis, we measured the effect of @PROTEIN$ on RyR2 channels from mice and sheep and on intact mouse cardiomyocytes loaded with the Ca(2+) fluorescent indicator @COMPOUND$ acetoxymethyl ester.	0
548	To test this hypothesis, we measured the effect of AMT on @PROTEIN$ channels from mice and sheep and on intact mouse cardiomyocytes loaded with the Ca(2+) fluorescent indicator @COMPOUND$ acetoxymethyl ester.	0
549	To test this hypothesis, we measured the effect of @PROTEIN$ on RyR2 channels from mice and sheep and on intact mouse cardiomyocytes loaded with the Ca(2+) fluorescent indicator Fura-2 @COMPOUND$ ester.	0
550	To test this hypothesis, we measured the effect of AMT on @PROTEIN$ channels from mice and sheep and on intact mouse cardiomyocytes loaded with the Ca(2+) fluorescent indicator Fura-2 @COMPOUND$ ester.	0
551	In contrast to newborn myocytes, @COMPOUND$ had no effect on @PROTEIN$ under control conditions in adult myocytes but induced a negative shift with no change in amplitude when saturated cAMP was added to the pipette solution.	0
552	In contrast to newborn myocytes, erbstatin had no effect on @PROTEIN$ under control conditions in adult myocytes but induced a negative shift with no change in amplitude when saturated @COMPOUND$ was added to the pipette solution.	0
