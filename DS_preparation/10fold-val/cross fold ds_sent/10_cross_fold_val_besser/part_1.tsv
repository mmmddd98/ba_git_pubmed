549	In this study, we demonstrate that @COMPOUND$-induced angiogenesis and VEGF upregulation are modulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (@PROTEIN$), a ligand-inducible transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and plays multiple biological activities in the vascular system.	1
550	In this study, we demonstrate that @COMPOUND$-induced angiogenesis and VEGF upregulation are modulated by @PROTEIN$ (PPARalpha), a ligand-inducible transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and plays multiple biological activities in the vascular system.	1
551	Moreover, both lung and plasma concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumour necrosis factor-alpha and @PROTEIN$ were higher in @COMPOUND$-treated animals at this time-point.	1
552	DNA array studies have revealed that @PROTEIN$ is strongly up-regulated by nitroso-glutathione (@COMPOUND$) and also displays a 12-fold increase in expression during biofilm growth of E. coli 83972 and VR50 in human urine.	1
553	Finally, we provided evidence for @COMPOUND$ as an endovanilloid substance in the striatum, since genetic inhibition of anandamide degradation resulted in a tonic activation of @PROTEIN$ channels modulating glutamate but not GABA release.	1
554	In addition, @COMPOUND$ deficiency down-regulated @PROTEIN$ 6 mRNA expression while up-regulating toll-like receptors 2 and 5 mRNA expressions.	1
555	Results showed that a moderate dose of leptin (250 microg/kg body weight/day) injected during the re-feeding period: (i) promoted the recovery of the regressed ovary as evidenced by an increase in ovary weight and recovery of yellow hierarchical follicles; (ii) elevated the plasma @COMPOUND$ (E(2)) level; (iii) increased the mRNA levels of ovary follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), luteinizing hormone receptor (@PROTEIN$) and estrogen receptor-beta (ER-beta).	0
556	Results showed that a moderate dose of leptin (250 microg/kg body weight/day) injected during the re-feeding period: (i) promoted the recovery of the regressed ovary as evidenced by an increase in ovary weight and recovery of yellow hierarchical follicles; (ii) elevated the plasma @COMPOUND$ (E(2)) level; (iii) increased the mRNA levels of ovary follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) and @PROTEIN$ (ER-beta).	0
557	Results showed that a moderate dose of leptin (250 microg/kg body weight/day) injected during the re-feeding period: (i) promoted the recovery of the regressed ovary as evidenced by an increase in ovary weight and recovery of yellow hierarchical follicles; (ii) elevated the plasma @COMPOUND$ (E(2)) level; (iii) increased the mRNA levels of ovary follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), @PROTEIN$ (LHR) and estrogen receptor-beta (ER-beta).	0

559	Results showed that a moderate dose of leptin (250 microg/kg body weight/day) injected during the re-feeding period: (i) promoted the recovery of the regressed ovary as evidenced by an increase in ovary weight and recovery of yellow hierarchical follicles; (ii) elevated the plasma @COMPOUND$ (E(2)) level; (iii) increased the mRNA levels of ovary follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (@PROTEIN$), luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) and estrogen receptor-beta (ER-beta).	0
560	Results showed that a moderate dose of @PROTEIN$ (250 microg/kg body weight/day) injected during the re-feeding period: (i) promoted the recovery of the regressed ovary as evidenced by an increase in ovary weight and recovery of yellow hierarchical follicles; (ii) elevated the plasma @COMPOUND$ (E(2)) level; (iii) increased the mRNA levels of ovary follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), luteinizing hormone receptor (LHR) and estrogen receptor-beta (ER-beta).	1
561	Both activity and expression of @PROTEIN$ and APS reductase in plants are modulated by the @COMPOUND$ status of the plant.	1
