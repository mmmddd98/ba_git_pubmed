535	The present findings suggest that the efficacy of betaxolol treatment on @COMPOUND$ withdrawal-induced anxiety may be related, in part, to its effect on amygdalar beta(1)-adrenergic receptor, modulation of its downstream cell-signaling elements and @PROTEIN$ gene expression.	0
536	The present findings suggest that the efficacy of @COMPOUND$ treatment on cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety may be related, in part, to its effect on amygdalar beta(1)-adrenergic receptor, modulation of its downstream cell-signaling elements and @PROTEIN$ gene expression.	1
537	Recognition of @COMPOUND$ components of pectin by @PROTEIN$.	1
538	ERK and/or PI3K pathway inhibitors and RSK1 small hairpin RNA knockdown reduced, but did not abolish, baseline and @COMPOUND$-induced promoter activities and lowered @PROTEIN$ protein levels.	0
539	In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism through which @PROTEIN$ is up-regulated by @COMPOUND$ using cultured human neuron-like cells.	1
540	"Lack of @COMPOUND$ significantly changed mucin (MUC) dynamics, as reflected by the enlarged goblet-cell ""cup"" area relative to controls; decreased @PROTEIN$ mRNA expression in the jejunum, ileum and colon of VAD rats and increased MUC3 mRNA expression in the ileum and colon of these rats."	1
541	"Lack of @COMPOUND$ significantly changed mucin (MUC) dynamics, as reflected by the enlarged goblet-cell ""cup"" area relative to controls; decreased MUC2 mRNA expression in the jejunum, ileum and colon of VAD rats and increased @PROTEIN$ mRNA expression in the ileum and colon of these rats."	1
542	@COMPOUND$ can change the conformation of the active sites and decrease obviously the affinities between gliclazide in the active site and enzymes when it is docked in the second active sites in CYP2C9 and @PROTEIN$.	1
543	Gliclazide can change the conformation of the active sites and decrease obviously the affinities between @COMPOUND$ in the active site and enzymes when it is docked in the second active sites in @PROTEIN$ and CYP2C19.	1
544	@COMPOUND$ can change the conformation of the active sites and decrease obviously the affinities between gliclazide in the active site and enzymes when it is docked in the second active sites in @PROTEIN$ and CYP2C19.	1
545	Gliclazide can change the conformation of the active sites and decrease obviously the affinities between @COMPOUND$ in the active site and enzymes when it is docked in the second active sites in CYP2C9 and @PROTEIN$.	1
546	Rac1 (-/-) platelets displayed defective thrombus formation on collagen under flow conditions which could be fully restored by co-infusion of ADP and the @COMPOUND$) analog U46619, indicating that impaired @PROTEIN$-, but not G-protein signaling, was responsible for the observed defect.	0
547	@PROTEIN$ (-/-) platelets displayed defective thrombus formation on collagen under flow conditions which could be fully restored by co-infusion of ADP and the @COMPOUND$) analog U46619, indicating that impaired GPVI-, but not G-protein signaling, was responsible for the observed defect.	0
548	Suppression of retinal @PROTEIN$ in experimental diabetes and @COMPOUND$-induced retinopathy: role of NADPH oxidase.	0
549	The metal-coordinating residues in the active site of @PROTEIN$ include a conserved @COMPOUND$ that clearly distinguishes this protein from previously structurally characterized members of the M20 peptidase family.	1
550	Activation of the Na+/K+-ATPase by @PROTEIN$ and @COMPOUND$ as a putative negative feedback mechanism in pancreatic beta-cells.	0
551	@COMPOUND$ up-regulates and activates @PROTEIN$-zeta in EBV-infected and EBV-transformed human B-cells.	1
