547	Both promoters are partially regulated by @COMPOUND$ via @PROTEIN$ and other RARs.	1
548	@COMPOUND$ regulates expressions of VEGF and @PROTEIN$ stimulated by STZ.	1
549	@COMPOUND$ regulates expressions of @PROTEIN$ and HIF-1alpha stimulated by STZ.	1
550	The role of @COMPOUND$ in the treatment of obesity through @PROTEIN$ antagonism.	1
551	Administration of @COMPOUND$ to inhibit HMGB1 or anti-RAGE antibody could significantly decrease expression levels of CTLA-4, @PROTEIN$ on Tregs, and IL-10 production after burns.	1
552	Administration of @COMPOUND$ to inhibit HMGB1 or anti-RAGE antibody could significantly decrease expression levels of CTLA-4, Foxp3 on Tregs, and @PROTEIN$ production after burns.	1
553	Administration of @COMPOUND$ to inhibit HMGB1 or anti-RAGE antibody could significantly decrease expression levels of @PROTEIN$, Foxp3 on Tregs, and IL-10 production after burns.	1
554	In summary, ischaemia and @PROTEIN$ independently stimulate skeletal muscle @COMPOUND$ uptake in vivo in humans, whereas ischaemia and contraction do not.	1
555	Vernakalant was metabolized rapidly via 4-O-demethylation by @PROTEIN$ (CYP)2D6 to its major metabolite RSD1385, which then circulated predominantly as an inactive @COMPOUND$ conjugate.	0
556	Vernakalant was metabolized rapidly via 4-O-demethylation by cytochrome P450 (@PROTEIN$)2D6 to its major metabolite RSD1385, which then circulated predominantly as an inactive @COMPOUND$ conjugate.	0
557	Cyclophilin A (CypA), a receptor for the immunosuppressive agent @COMPOUND$ (CsA), is a cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (@PROTEIN$) which accelerates the cis-trans isomerization of prolyl-peptide bonds, interacts with a variety of proteins and therefore regulates their activities.	0
558	Cyclophilin A (@PROTEIN$), a receptor for the immunosuppressive agent @COMPOUND$ (CsA), is a cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) which accelerates the cis-trans isomerization of prolyl-peptide bonds, interacts with a variety of proteins and therefore regulates their activities.	1
559	@PROTEIN$ (CypA), a receptor for the immunosuppressive agent @COMPOUND$ (CsA), is a cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase (PPIase) which accelerates the cis-trans isomerization of prolyl-peptide bonds, interacts with a variety of proteins and therefore regulates their activities.	1
560	The results showed that @COMPOUND$ augmented splenic-specific IgG1 and IL-4 as well as cell proliferation but suppressed specific IgG2a and @PROTEIN$ levels.	1
561	The results showed that @COMPOUND$ augmented splenic-specific IgG1 and @PROTEIN$ as well as cell proliferation but suppressed specific IgG2a and IFN-gamma levels.	1
562	Accordingly, to assess its potential role in the long-lasting behavioral effects of drugs of abuse, we have investigated the impact of @PROTEIN$ deletion on sustained behavioral responses elicited by repeated @COMPOUND$ administration.	0
563	Furthermore, @COMPOUND$ induced nucleus translocalization of p53 and @PROTEIN$ and recruitment of autophagosomes.	1
