539	Cell viability (MTT colorimetric determination) and transmembrane mitochondrial potential (J-C1 fluorescence) were concentration-dependently reduced 24 h after NaN (3); neither nuclear fragmentation by @COMPOUND$, nor @PROTEIN$ positivity by flow cytometry were detected, ruling out the occurrence of apoptosis.	0
540	To determine whether hCG stimulation of tPA and @PROTEIN$ requires PGE2, granulosa cells obtained at 0 h were cultured with hCG plus @COMPOUND$ to inhibit PG production; some cells also received PGE2 or an agonist selective for one PGE2 receptor (EP).	0
