545	Among seven additives tested, Tween 20, Tween 80 and @COMPOUND$ exhibited the best results in respect of preventing the formation of rhG-@PROTEIN$ protein aggregates.	1
546	@COMPOUND$ (1-ABT) is generally considered to be a nonselective mechanism-based inactivator of both human and non-human @PROTEIN$ (P450) enzymes.	1
547	We also found an inhibitory effect of @COMPOUND$ on the associations between cadherin 5, @PROTEIN$ and CD31, adherens junction proteins whose interaction is critical for endothelial cell cord formation.	1
548	We show that the effects of both @PROTEIN$-2 and @COMPOUND$ are mediated through FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) and that inhibition of signaling through this receptor arrests cell growth, resulting in the cells being unable to reach the critical density necessary to induce differentiation.	0
