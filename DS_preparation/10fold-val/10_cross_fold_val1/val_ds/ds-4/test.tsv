541	Effect of obestatin on @PROTEIN$, glucagon and @COMPOUND$ secretion in the perfused rat pancreas.	0
542	The potentiated effect of obestatin on @COMPOUND$-induced @PROTEIN$ output was not observed in the presence of diazoxide, an agent that activates ATP-dependent K(+) channels, thus suggesting that these channels might be sensitive to this peptide.	1
543	The potentiated effect of @PROTEIN$ on @COMPOUND$-induced insulin output was not observed in the presence of diazoxide, an agent that activates ATP-dependent K(+) channels, thus suggesting that these channels might be sensitive to this peptide.	1
544	The potentiated effect of obestatin on glucose-induced @PROTEIN$ output was not observed in the presence of @COMPOUND$, an agent that activates ATP-dependent K(+) channels, thus suggesting that these channels might be sensitive to this peptide.	1
545	The potentiated effect of @PROTEIN$ on glucose-induced insulin output was not observed in the presence of @COMPOUND$, an agent that activates ATP-dependent K(+) channels, thus suggesting that these channels might be sensitive to this peptide.	1
546	When Vitreoscilla were grown in medium containing 60mM @COMPOUND$ under both normal and limited aeration conditions, the levels of Vitreoscilla @PROTEIN$ (VHb) were decreased by greater than 90%, while the levels of the terminal respiratory oxidase, cytochrome bo, were increased 350% under normal aeration and 7-23% under limited aeration.	1
547	Furthermore, @COMPOUND$ regulated endogenous survival signaling by up-regulating phosphorylated @PROTEIN$ that returned to its basal level later.	1
