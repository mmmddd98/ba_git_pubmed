542	Quercetin inhibits vascular @COMPOUND$ production induced by endothelin-1 : Role of NADPH oxidase, uncoupled @PROTEIN$ and PKC.	0
543	Quercetin inhibits vascular @COMPOUND$ production induced by @PROTEIN$ : Role of NADPH oxidase, uncoupled eNOS and PKC.	1
544	@COMPOUND$ inhibits vascular superoxide production induced by @PROTEIN$ : Role of NADPH oxidase, uncoupled eNOS and PKC.	1
545	Furthermore, ET-1 increased intracellular O(2*)(-) production in all layers of the vessel, protein expression of NADPH oxidase subunit @PROTEIN$ (phox) without affecting p22 (phox) expression and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence signal stimulated by @COMPOUND$.	0
546	Furthermore, ET-1 increased intracellular O(2*)(-) production in all layers of the vessel, protein expression of NADPH oxidase subunit p47 (phox) without affecting @PROTEIN$ (phox) expression and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence signal stimulated by @COMPOUND$.	0
547	Moreover, quercetin but not @COMPOUND$, inhibited the increased @PROTEIN$ activity induced by ET-1.	0
548	Moreover, @COMPOUND$ but not isorhamnetin, inhibited the increased @PROTEIN$ activity induced by ET-1.	1
549	Taken together these results indicate that ET-1-induced NADPH oxidase up-regulation and @PROTEIN$ uncoupling via PKC leading to endothelial dysfunction and these effects were prevented by quercetin and @COMPOUND$.	1
550	Taken together these results indicate that ET-1-induced NADPH oxidase up-regulation and eNOS uncoupling via @PROTEIN$ leading to endothelial dysfunction and these effects were prevented by quercetin and @COMPOUND$.	1
551	Taken together these results indicate that ET-1-induced NADPH oxidase up-regulation and @PROTEIN$ uncoupling via PKC leading to endothelial dysfunction and these effects were prevented by @COMPOUND$ and isorhamnetin.	1
552	Taken together these results indicate that ET-1-induced NADPH oxidase up-regulation and eNOS uncoupling via @PROTEIN$ leading to endothelial dysfunction and these effects were prevented by @COMPOUND$ and isorhamnetin.	1
553	The mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi (mit)) was also tested with @COMPOUND$ 30 min after SI challenge, and was shown to have collapsed in the incompatible pollen tubes after exposure to @PROTEIN$.	1
