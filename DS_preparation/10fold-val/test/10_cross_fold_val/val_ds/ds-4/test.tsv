521	Furthermore, ET-1 increased intracellular O(2*)(-) production in all layers of the vessel, protein expression of NADPH oxidase subunit @PROTEIN$ (phox) without affecting p22 (phox) expression and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence signal stimulated by @COMPOUND$.	0
522	Furthermore, ET-1 increased intracellular O(2*)(-) production in all layers of the vessel, protein expression of NADPH oxidase subunit p47 (phox) without affecting @PROTEIN$ (phox) expression and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence signal stimulated by @COMPOUND$.	0
523	Moreover, quercetin but not @COMPOUND$, inhibited the increased @PROTEIN$ activity induced by ET-1.	0
524	Moreover, @COMPOUND$ but not isorhamnetin, inhibited the increased @PROTEIN$ activity induced by ET-1.	1
525	Taken together these results indicate that ET-1-induced NADPH oxidase up-regulation and @PROTEIN$ uncoupling via PKC leading to endothelial dysfunction and these effects were prevented by quercetin and @COMPOUND$.	1
526	Taken together these results indicate that ET-1-induced NADPH oxidase up-regulation and eNOS uncoupling via @PROTEIN$ leading to endothelial dysfunction and these effects were prevented by quercetin and @COMPOUND$.	1
527	Taken together these results indicate that ET-1-induced NADPH oxidase up-regulation and @PROTEIN$ uncoupling via PKC leading to endothelial dysfunction and these effects were prevented by @COMPOUND$ and isorhamnetin.	1
528	Taken together these results indicate that ET-1-induced NADPH oxidase up-regulation and eNOS uncoupling via @PROTEIN$ leading to endothelial dysfunction and these effects were prevented by @COMPOUND$ and isorhamnetin.	1
529	We investigated whether several different inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein (@PROTEIN$) and fibrinogen and white blood cells (WBCs) count, are associated with maximal @COMPOUND$ consumption (VO(2 max)) in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).	0

533	The recent approval of @COMPOUND$, sorafenib, temsirolimus and bevacizumab in combination with @PROTEIN$ has revolutionized the management of renal cell carcinoma.	0
534	Surprisingly, a deletion of the @PROTEIN$ gene affected not only insoluble @COMPOUND$) reduction, which requires pili, but also soluble Fe(III) reduction, which, in contrast, does not require pili.	1
535	Fibril growth was a second-order process with an enthalpy of activation (27+/-5 kcal mol(-1)), which is indistinguishable from that of tetramer formation by @PROTEIN$, which involves limited conformational changes including @COMPOUND$ trans to cis isomerization.	1
