531	In the present study we explored the possibility of using genetic engineering to increase the @COMPOUND$ content of A. annua by suppressing the expression of @PROTEIN$ (squalene synthase), a key enzyme of sterol pathway (a pathway competitive with that of artemisinin biosynthesis) by means of a hairpin-RNA-mediated RNAi (RNA interference) technique.	0
532	Hepatic stellate cell activation in focal nodular hyperplasia with a central scar was accompanied by the expression of @COMPOUND$ and inducible @PROTEIN$ in the liver.	0
