536	BMI and testosterone levels were evaluated for their ability to predict overall survival (OS) and prostate-specific antigen (@PROTEIN$) declines in the TAX327 clinical trial, an international phase III randomized trial of one of the two schedules of docetaxel and @COMPOUND$ compared with mitoxantrone and prednisone.	0
537	In multivariate analysis, neither BMI, presence of obesity, nor baseline @COMPOUND$ was significantly associated with OS or @PROTEIN$ declines.	0
538	Increased incorporation of dietary plant sterols and @COMPOUND$ correlates with decreased expression of hepatic and intestinal Abcg5 and @PROTEIN$ in diabetic BB rats.	1
539	Increased incorporation of dietary plant sterols and @COMPOUND$ correlates with decreased expression of hepatic and intestinal @PROTEIN$ and Abcg8 in diabetic BB rats.	1
540	This increase in @COMPOUND$ and plant sterols and stanols was associated with a marked decrease in hepatic and intestinal Abcg5 (ATP-binding cassette transporter G5) and @PROTEIN$ (ATP-binding cassette transporter G8) expressions in diabetic rats, as well as decreased mRNA levels of several other genes involved in sterol regulation.	1
541	This increase in @COMPOUND$ and plant sterols and stanols was associated with a marked decrease in hepatic and intestinal @PROTEIN$ (ATP-binding cassette transporter G5) and Abcg8 (ATP-binding cassette transporter G8) expressions in diabetic rats, as well as decreased mRNA levels of several other genes involved in sterol regulation.	1
542	Therefore, lower expression levels of Abcg5/@PROTEIN$ in diabetic rats may account for the increased accumulation of plant sterols and @COMPOUND$ in these rats.	1
543	Therefore, lower expression levels of @PROTEIN$/Abcg8 in diabetic rats may account for the increased accumulation of plant sterols and @COMPOUND$ in these rats.	1
544	Administration of @COMPOUND$ to DMH treated rats significantly decreased the tumor incidence, the number of aberrant crypt foci with simultaneous enhancement of tissue lipid peroxidation, GST, GPx, @PROTEIN$, and CAT activities.	1
545	Administration of @COMPOUND$ to DMH treated rats significantly decreased the tumor incidence, the number of aberrant crypt foci with simultaneous enhancement of tissue lipid peroxidation, @PROTEIN$, GPx, SOD, and CAT activities.	1
