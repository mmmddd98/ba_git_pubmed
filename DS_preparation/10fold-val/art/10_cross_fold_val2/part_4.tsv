581	Soluble P-selectin reduced the number of platelet-decorated @PROTEIN$ strings in the absence of @COMPOUND$+) and Mg(2+) but had no effect in the presence of these cations.	1
582	It controls the expression of a total of 11 genes, the @PROTEIN$ regulon, in a @COMPOUND$-dependent manner.	1
583	The aim of this study was to determine the effect of @COMPOUND$ on endothelial function in anti-tumour necrosis factor (@PROTEIN$)-naive RA patients.	1
584	On hexanoamide the @PROTEIN$ exhibited a K(m) value of 5.5 mM compared to 0.07 mM for @COMPOUND$.	1
585	On @COMPOUND$ the @PROTEIN$ exhibited a K(m) value of 5.5 mM compared to 0.07 mM for p-nitroacetanilide.	1
586	Overexpression of @PROTEIN$ induces HepG2 cells death by the AMP kinase activator @COMPOUND$ (AICAR).	1
