552	In this study, we demonstrate that @COMPOUND$-induced angiogenesis and @PROTEIN$ upregulation are modulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha), a ligand-inducible transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily and plays multiple biological activities in the vascular system.	1

556	Importantly, mice lacking the PPARalpha gene exhibit a normal angiogenic response to @PROTEIN$, indicating that the absence of PPARalpha does not result in a general impairment of angiogenesis, but specifically affects the ability of @COMPOUND$ to induce angiogenesis.	1
557	We looked at the toxicity of non-drug-containing liposomes on (3)H-@COMPOUND$ incorporation by @PROTEIN$ (Con A)-stimulated human lymphocytes, splenocytes and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed human B-cell lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL).	1
