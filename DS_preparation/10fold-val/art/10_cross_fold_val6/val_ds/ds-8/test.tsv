536	Immunoblot analysis of signaling molecules, including cyclic-@PROTEIN$ response element binding protein (CREB), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKp44/42; ERK1/2), in area CA1 revealed that @COMPOUND$ treatment reversed hypothyroidism-induced reduction of signaling molecules essential for learning and memory, and L-LTP.	0
537	The slow BSO-induced @COMPOUND$ depletion allows separation of two redox-related phases, namely, early thiol disequilibrium and late frank oxidative stress; each phase contributes to the progressive activation of a @PROTEIN$-p50 homodimer.	0
538	However, in addition to @PROTEIN$ activity, we discovered that EGST also possesses @COMPOUND$ : disulfide oxidoreductase activity, for which the residue Cys (10) plays an essential role.	0
539	However, in addition to GST activity, we discovered that EGST also possesses @COMPOUND$ : @PROTEIN$ activity, for which the residue Cys (10) plays an essential role.	0
540	KiSS-1 mRNA was significantly increased by seizure activity in rats and when neuronal activity in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures was enhanced by kainate or @COMPOUND$, while mRNA for @PROTEIN$ remained essentially unchanged.	0
541	KiSS-1 mRNA was significantly increased by seizure activity in rats and when neuronal activity in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures was enhanced by @COMPOUND$ or picrotoxin, while mRNA for @PROTEIN$ remained essentially unchanged.	0
542	Serum @PROTEIN$ levels were increased and plasma levels of @COMPOUND$ and MHPG were decreased according to the recovery from the active phase of the disease.	0
543	Serum @PROTEIN$ levels were increased and plasma levels of HVA and @COMPOUND$ were decreased according to the recovery from the active phase of the disease.	0
