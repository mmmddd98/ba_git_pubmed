512	In conclusion, @COMPOUND$-A has sufficient bonding strength and comparatively low toxicity in clinical use of 0.3 mmol or less of TAD and 0.8 mL of 44 w/w % @PROTEIN$ solution.	0
513	Dopamine release and direct stimulation of dopamine D2 and serotonin @PROTEIN$ receptors also contributes to the overall action of @COMPOUND$.	1
514	Our findings suggest that @COMPOUND$ differentially affects higher cognitive functions, but does not support the hypothesis from animal studies, that some of the MDMA effects are causally mediated through action at the @PROTEIN$ receptor system.	0
515	Other factors prognostic for inferior survival were @PROTEIN$ 37 g/L (HR 3.22, 95% CI 1.11-13.22, p = 0.034) and treatment with non-cyclophosphamide, @COMPOUND$, vincristine, and prednisolone chemotherapy (HR 4.89, 95% CI 1.67-14.36, p = 0.004).	0
516	Other factors prognostic for inferior survival were @PROTEIN$ 37 g/L (HR 3.22, 95% CI 1.11-13.22, p = 0.034) and treatment with non-@COMPOUND$, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone chemotherapy (HR 4.89, 95% CI 1.67-14.36, p = 0.004).	0
517	Other factors prognostic for inferior survival were @PROTEIN$ 37 g/L (HR 3.22, 95% CI 1.11-13.22, p = 0.034) and treatment with non-cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, @COMPOUND$, and prednisolone chemotherapy (HR 4.89, 95% CI 1.67-14.36, p = 0.004).	0
518	Other factors prognostic for inferior survival were @PROTEIN$ 37 g/L (HR 3.22, 95% CI 1.11-13.22, p = 0.034) and treatment with non-cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and @COMPOUND$ chemotherapy (HR 4.89, 95% CI 1.67-14.36, p = 0.004).	0
519	We previously determined that @PROTEIN$ Tyr51 is a canonical and Trp150 an anti-canonical TEM-1-contact residue, where canonical refers to the @COMPOUND$ substitution resulting in a matched change in the hydrophobicity of binding free energy.	1
520	We previously determined that BLIP Tyr51 is a canonical and Trp150 an anti-canonical @PROTEIN$-contact residue, where canonical refers to the @COMPOUND$ substitution resulting in a matched change in the hydrophobicity of binding free energy.	1
521	This explains the anti-canonical nature of the Trp150 to @COMPOUND$ substitution, and also reveals a strong long distance coupling between Trp150 and Asp49 of @PROTEIN$, because these two residues are more than 25 angstroms apart.	1
522	According to @PROTEIN$-binding, arsenic trioxide (7 microM) within 48 h significantly increased @COMPOUND$ exposure of human erythrocytes without inducing hemolysis.	0
