530	In this paper we demonstrate that hedgehog signaling antagonists, including @COMPOUND$, and a second compound, CUR0199691, can inhibit growth of @PROTEIN$ (ER)-positive and ER-negative tumorigenic breast cancer cells at elevated doses.	0
531	The model was used to investigate how on-treatment @PROTEIN$ related to baseline CRP and estimated treatment effects with @COMPOUND$.	1
532	@COMPOUND$ selectively causes Bax- and @PROTEIN$-mediated apoptosis in human lung cancer cells.	1
533	@COMPOUND$ selectively causes @PROTEIN$- and Bak-mediated apoptosis in human lung cancer cells.	1
534	The @COMPOUND$-mediated G2-M phase cell cycle arrest was explained by down-regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (@PROTEIN$) and cell division cycle 25C protein expression leading to accumulation of Tyr15 phosphorylated (inactive) Cdk1.	1
535	The @COMPOUND$-mediated G2-M phase cell cycle arrest was explained by down-regulation of @PROTEIN$ (Cdk1) and cell division cycle 25C protein expression leading to accumulation of Tyr15 phosphorylated (inactive) Cdk1.	1
536	Knockdown of Bax and @PROTEIN$ proteins conferred significant protection against @COMPOUND$-induced apoptotic cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation.	0
537	Knockdown of @PROTEIN$ and Bak proteins conferred significant protection against @COMPOUND$-induced apoptotic cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation.	0
538	Serine and cysteine @PROTEIN$ proved to be suitable tools for the production of amino acids and peptides conjugated to @COMPOUND$, whereas metalloproteases do not seem to be very qualified for accepting this nucleophile.	0
539	Effects of weight loss on visceral and abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue blood-flow and @PROTEIN$-mediated @COMPOUND$ uptake in healthy obese subjects.	1
540	Mechanism-based inactivation of @PROTEIN$ by tienilic acid and (+/-)-@COMPOUND$ : a comparison of kinetics and probe substrate selection.	1
541	Mechanism-based inactivation of @PROTEIN$ by @COMPOUND$ and (+/-)-suprofen : a comparison of kinetics and probe substrate selection.	1
542	In vitro experiments were conducted to compare k(inact), K(I) and inactivation efficiency (k(inact)/K(I)) of @PROTEIN$ (P450) 2C9 by @COMPOUND$ and (+/-)-suprofen using (S)-flurbiprofen, diclofenac, and (S)-warfarin as reporter substrates.	1
543	In vitro experiments were conducted to compare k(inact), K(I) and inactivation efficiency (k(inact)/K(I)) of @PROTEIN$ (P450) 2C9 by tienilic acid and (+/-)-@COMPOUND$ using (S)-flurbiprofen, diclofenac, and (S)-warfarin as reporter substrates.	1
544	Intranasal and intravenous administration of live Cpn and Aa, respectively induced an accumulation of activated mast cells in the aortic sinus of apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, however, with varying responses in the systemic levels of @COMPOUND$ (LPS) and @PROTEIN$.	0
