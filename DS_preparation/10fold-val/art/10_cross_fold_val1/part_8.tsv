529	@PROTEIN$ antagonism augments @COMPOUND$-induced downregulation of the 5-HT transporter.	1
530	In contrast, chronic @COMPOUND$ markedly decreased 5-@PROTEIN$ levels in all regions.	1
531	This downregulation of 5-@PROTEIN$ by @COMPOUND$ and its enhancement by Org 34850 can explain our recent observation that GR antagonists augment the SSRI-induced increase in extracellular 5-HT.	1
532	After 10 days of treatment, otomicroscopic evaluation of tympanic membranes and measurement of anti-inflammatory mediators such as @PROTEIN$, nitrite/nitrate, glutathione peroxidase and @COMPOUND$ were performed.	0
533	After 10 days of treatment, otomicroscopic evaluation of tympanic membranes and measurement of anti-inflammatory mediators such as superoxide dismutase, nitrite/nitrate, @PROTEIN$ and @COMPOUND$ were performed.	0
534	The levels of @COMPOUND$ and @PROTEIN$ were lower in ginkgo groups but not significantly.	0
535	By using the system, we obtained four event timing data sets (stimulation by @PROTEIN$ with and without @COMPOUND$ at the concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, and 1 microM).	0
536	Association between @COMPOUND$ (247) polymorphism of @PROTEIN$ and cerebral infarction in a Chinese population.	1
537	The purpose of this study was to identify associations between the @COMPOUND$ (247) polymorphism of @PROTEIN$ gene and CI in a Chinese cohort.	1
538	Reduced responses of alpha-MSH or @PROTEIN$-beta-END IRM to CRH and the invalid suppression by @COMPOUND$ reflect a state of dysfunction of the melanotroph-type POMC system in nonsurvivors.	0

543	These were mutated in onion vacuolar invertase (acINV) according to the residue in festuca @COMPOUND$ : @PROTEIN$-fructosyltransferase (saSST) and vice versa.	0
544	Chondroitin lyases (or @PROTEIN$) are a family of enzymes that depolymerize @COMPOUND$ (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) galactosaminoglycans, which have gained prominence as important players in central nervous system biology.	1
