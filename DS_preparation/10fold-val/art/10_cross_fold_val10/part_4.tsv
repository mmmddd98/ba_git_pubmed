523	We found that postovulatory administration of 1.5 mg of @COMPOUND$ to women with a subsequent or existing early pregnancy did not affect the immunohistochemical expressions of estrogen receptors (ER (alpha), ER (beta)), P receptors (PR(B), PR(A+B)), @PROTEIN$ (AR), or proliferation index Ki67 in the first-trimester decidua and chorionic villi.	0
524	However, in addition to @PROTEIN$ activity, we discovered that EGST also possesses @COMPOUND$ : disulfide oxidoreductase activity, for which the residue Cys (10) plays an essential role.	0
525	However, in addition to GST activity, we discovered that EGST also possesses @COMPOUND$ : @PROTEIN$ activity, for which the residue Cys (10) plays an essential role.	0
526	Administration of @COMPOUND$ to inhibit HMGB1 or anti-RAGE antibody could significantly decrease expression levels of CTLA-4, @PROTEIN$ on Tregs, and IL-10 production after burns.	1
527	Administration of @COMPOUND$ to inhibit HMGB1 or anti-RAGE antibody could significantly decrease expression levels of CTLA-4, Foxp3 on Tregs, and @PROTEIN$ production after burns.	1
528	Administration of @COMPOUND$ to inhibit HMGB1 or anti-RAGE antibody could significantly decrease expression levels of @PROTEIN$, Foxp3 on Tregs, and IL-10 production after burns.	1
529	Serum free @COMPOUND$ in association with @PROTEIN$ as a diagnostic marker of acute myocardial infarction.	1
