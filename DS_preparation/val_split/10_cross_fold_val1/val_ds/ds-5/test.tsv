526	In this study, we attempted to evaluate the effects of @COMPOUND$ on F-@PROTEIN$ and microtubular cytoskeletons in human hepatoma HepG2 cells and its possible molecular mechanisms.	1
527	Consequently, @COMPOUND$-caused cytoskeletal interruption led to suppression of @PROTEIN$ expression and its metabolizing activity.	1
528	Furthermore, we study the @PROTEIN$ activation after As(2)O(3) treatment and the HCC cells proliferation after combination of As(2)O(3) with PI3K inhibitor @COMPOUND$.	0
529	To confirm that mouse @PROTEIN$-PG possesses a single GAG chain attached to Ser (89), we substituted Ser (89) by @COMPOUND$ (89).	1
530	After serum @COMPOUND$ reached a stable nadir in the transplant recipients, @PROTEIN$ and its hemodynamic determinants were evaluated and the whole allograft K(f) was computed.	0
531	We measured serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-@PROTEIN$), fetuin-A, IL-6, IL-18, IL-10 (ELISA) and others (haemoglobin level, white blood cell count, serum calcium, phosphate, calcium-phosphate product, albumin, fibrinogen, @COMPOUND$, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides and parathormone).	0
