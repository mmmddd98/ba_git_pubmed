561	The cells exposed to 10 microM (@COMPOUND$ for 3 h or to 40 microM (15S)-HETE for 6 h showed increased expression of Fas ligand and @PROTEIN$ (Fas-associated death domain), caspase 8 activation, Bid (BH3-interacting domain death agonist) cleavage, decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential, cytochrome c release, caspase 3 activation, PARP-1 (poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1) cleavage and DNA fragmentation, suggesting the involvement of both extrinsic and intrinsic death pathways.	1
