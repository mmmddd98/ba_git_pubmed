566	@COMPOUND$, a SSRI, is mainly metabolized by cytochrome P450 (@PROTEIN$) 2D6 and 1A2.	1
567	@COMPOUND$, a SSRI, is mainly metabolized by @PROTEIN$ (CYP) 2D6 and 1A2.	1
568	We therefore hypothesized that a diffusible product of the @PROTEIN$ enzyme reaction (possibly DAG (@COMPOUND$)) mediated the biological effects of the protein.	1
569	This finding led the authors to propose that @PROTEIN$ may be involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis through its potential role in @COMPOUND$ biosynthesis and stimulation of keratinocyte proliferation.	1
570	In this study, we began the characterization of @PROTEIN$ protein in order to determine whether it might play a role in @COMPOUND$ biosynthesis.	0
571	The preference for NAD(+) suggests that @PROTEIN$ is likely to function in the oxidative direction in vivo, further supporting its potential role in the oxidation of retinol to retinaldehyde for @COMPOUND$ biosynthesis in human keratinocytes.	1
572	VEGF, @PROTEIN$ and @COMPOUND$ levels in exhaled breath condensate and serum of patients with lung cancer.	0
573	@PROTEIN$, TNF-alpha and @COMPOUND$ levels in exhaled breath condensate and serum of patients with lung cancer.	0
574	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the levels of VEGF, @COMPOUND$ and @PROTEIN$ in EBC and serum of patients with primary lung cancer prior to the initiation of any treatment, in order to evaluate their possible diagnostic role.	0
575	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the levels of @PROTEIN$, @COMPOUND$ and TNF-alpha in EBC and serum of patients with primary lung cancer prior to the initiation of any treatment, in order to evaluate their possible diagnostic role.	0
576	Furthermore, associations between VEGF, @COMPOUND$ and @PROTEIN$ levels in EBC and serum with clinicopathologic factors were investigated.	0
577	Furthermore, associations between @PROTEIN$, @COMPOUND$ and TNF-alpha levels in EBC and serum with clinicopathologic factors were investigated.	0
578	@PROTEIN$, VEGF and @COMPOUND$ levels in EBC and serum were analyzed by an immunoenzymatic method (ELISA).	0
579	TNF-alpha, @PROTEIN$ and @COMPOUND$ levels in EBC and serum were analyzed by an immunoenzymatic method (ELISA).	0
580	In our microarray analysis we observed that Seven-in-Absentia Homolog 2 (SIAH2) levels were low in @PROTEIN$ (ER) positive breast tumors of patients resistant to first-line @COMPOUND$ therapy.	1
581	In our microarray analysis we observed that @PROTEIN$ (SIAH2) levels were low in estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast tumors of patients resistant to first-line @COMPOUND$ therapy.	1
582	In our microarray analysis we observed that Seven-in-Absentia Homolog 2 (@PROTEIN$) levels were low in estrogen receptor (ER) positive breast tumors of patients resistant to first-line @COMPOUND$ therapy.	1
583	We have discovered multiple genetic and biochemical differences between humans and these other hominids, in relation to @COMPOUND$ and in Siglecs (Sia-recognizing Ig superfamily @PROTEIN$).	0
584	@PROTEIN$ is an important neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) protein, which have been implicated in a wide range of @COMPOUND$+) signaling events in neurons and photoreceptors.	1
585	Recoverin is an important neuronal calcium sensor (@PROTEIN$) protein, which have been implicated in a wide range of @COMPOUND$+) signaling events in neurons and photoreceptors.	1
586	The inhibitory effect of @COMPOUND$ on the migration of ES-2 ovarian carcinoma cells involves a @PROTEIN$-dependent pathway.	1
587	This inhibitory effect is possibly mediated by a @COMPOUND$-dependent activation of the small GTPase @PROTEIN$ via Epac.	1
588	This inhibitory effect is possibly mediated by a @COMPOUND$-dependent activation of the small GTPase Rap1 via @PROTEIN$.	1
589	We have assessed the impact of the functional C-1019G variant of the @PROTEIN$ receptor on the response to @COMPOUND$ or haloperidol in a prospective, randomized, double-blind study.	1
