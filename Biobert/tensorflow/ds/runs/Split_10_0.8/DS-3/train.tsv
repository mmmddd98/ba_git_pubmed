The electrons released from @COMPOUND$ by @PROTEIN$ were transferred to CTC in the reaction medium, and CTC reduction activity could be assessed spectrophotometrically and spectrofluorometrically.	1
Goldfish scales were incubated either with 20:3n-9 or with @COMPOUND$ at 15 degrees C for 6 and 18 h. Both osteoblastic and osteoclastic activities in the scale were assessed by measuring alkaline phosphatase (@PROTEIN$) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, respectively.	0
Goldfish scales were incubated either with 20:3n-9 or with @COMPOUND$ at 15 degrees C for 6 and 18 h. Both osteoblastic and osteoclastic activities in the scale were assessed by measuring @PROTEIN$ (ALP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, respectively.	0
MC3T3-E1 cells (an osteoblast cell line derived from the mouse) were incubated with 20:3n-9 or @COMPOUND$ at 37 degrees C for 6 and 18 h. @PROTEIN$ activity in cell lysate was measured.	0
Reactive oxygen species induce phosphorylation of @COMPOUND$ 118 and 167 on @PROTEIN$ alpha.	1
Our data show for the first time that ROS can induce post-translational modifications of @PROTEIN$ at @COMPOUND$ 118 and serine 167, and may lead to ERalpha down-regulation in human breast cancer cells.	1
On hexanoamide the @PROTEIN$ exhibited a K(m) value of 5.5 mM compared to 0.07 mM for @COMPOUND$.	1
On @COMPOUND$ the @PROTEIN$ exhibited a K(m) value of 5.5 mM compared to 0.07 mM for p-nitroacetanilide.	1
@COMPOUND$ attenuates the HFS-induced, @PROTEIN$-mediated LTP in a dose-dependent manner in rat striatum.	1
@COMPOUND$ binding to human @PROTEIN$ : a study of protein conformation and binding affinity.	1
Adenosine nucleotide translocase (@PROTEIN$) translocates ADP/@COMPOUND$ across the inner mitochondrial membrane.	1
This review will focus on recent evidence that @COMPOUND$, @PROTEIN$ and neuropeptide Y act by converging on neuronal cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathways to alter the autonomic phenotype in both health and disease.	1
This review will focus on recent evidence that @COMPOUND$, natriuretic peptides and @PROTEIN$ act by converging on neuronal cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathways to alter the autonomic phenotype in both health and disease.	1
@COMPOUND$ dinucleotides identified in Bhlhb2, Pparg, @PROTEIN$, and Egr1 binding sites at the Prkce gene promoter were densely methylated in males and females and were unaffected by cocaine exposure.	1
