Here, the reversible unfolding of @COMPOUND$-@PROTEIN$ has been investigated by (1)H-NMR relaxometry, circular dichroism, and absorption spectroscopy.	1
However, these events were blocked by treatment with the antioxidant, @COMPOUND$ (NAC), as well as @PROTEIN$ overexpression.	0
Changes in @COMPOUND$ consumption and the RQ ratio during sedentary and low-intensity exercise were not different between alpha(1)-@PROTEIN$-DN and WT.	0
The electrons released from @COMPOUND$ by @PROTEIN$ were transferred to CTC in the reaction medium, and CTC reduction activity could be assessed spectrophotometrically and spectrofluorometrically.	1
Therapeutic efficacy of 177Lu-CHX-A''-DTPA-hu3S193 radioimmunotherapy in prostate cancer is enhanced by @PROTEIN$ inhibition or @COMPOUND$ chemotherapy.	0
The purpose of this research was to enhance intranasal drug targeting to the CNS by incorporating a vasoconstrictor (phenylephrine (PHE)) into nasal formulations containing therapeutic @PROTEIN$ (hypocretin-1 (HC) or the dipeptide L-Tyr-D-Arg (D-@COMPOUND$)).	0
The purpose of this research was to enhance intranasal drug targeting to the CNS by incorporating a vasoconstrictor (phenylephrine (PHE)) into nasal formulations containing therapeutic neuropeptides (@PROTEIN$ (HC) or the dipeptide L-Tyr-D-Arg (D-@COMPOUND$)).	0
@COMPOUND$ dinucleotides identified in Bhlhb2, Pparg, @PROTEIN$, and Egr1 binding sites at the Prkce gene promoter were densely methylated in males and females and were unaffected by cocaine exposure.	1
