2765	In addition, increased signal transducer and activator of transcription factors (STAT) 1 and @PROTEIN$ were observed in @COMPOUND$ treated IL-10 KO mice.	1
2766	However, under the pressure of a death stimulus such as @COMPOUND$ treatment, L. infantum @PROTEIN$ is released from the single mitochondrion and translocates to the nucleus, where it is thought to participate in the process of DNA degradation that is associated with programmed cell death.	1
2767	However, these events were blocked by treatment with the antioxidant, @COMPOUND$ (NAC), as well as @PROTEIN$ overexpression.	0
2768	This analysis reveals @PROTEIN$ as major and unsuspected gates of @COMPOUND$+) entry that contribute, depending on context, to activation of transcription factors, apoptosis, vascular contractility, platelet activation, and cardiac hypertrophy, as well as to normal and abnormal cell proliferation.	1
2769	A single bout of exercise increases @COMPOUND$ uptake and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle, with a corresponding activation of AMP-activated @PROTEIN$ (AMPK).	1
2770	A single bout of exercise increases @COMPOUND$ uptake and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle, with a corresponding activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (@PROTEIN$).	1
2771	Changes in @COMPOUND$ consumption and the RQ ratio during sedentary and low-intensity exercise were not different between alpha(1)-@PROTEIN$-DN and WT.	0

2776	Reactivity of @COMPOUND$ with the (4Fe-4S) cluster of @PROTEIN$ from Escherichia coli.	1
2777	The rate constant for the initial reaction between NO and the @PROTEIN$ (@COMPOUND$ is estimated to be (7.0+/-2.0)x10(6) M(-2) x s(-1) at 25 degrees C, which is approx.	1
2778	Acylcarnitines have been suggested to play a role in @PROTEIN$ resistance, as well as other @COMPOUND$ metabolites.	0
2779	In the present study we investigated whether muscle long-chain acylcarnitines increase during fasting and we investigated their relationship with @COMPOUND$/fat oxidation and @PROTEIN$ sensitivity in lean healthy humans.	0
2780	These results suggest that @PROTEIN$ delivers @COMPOUND$ to mitochondria where regulatory oxysterols are generated.	1
2781	@PROTEIN$ promoter hypermethylation correlates with a survival benefit from @COMPOUND$ in patients with recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma but not glioblastoma.	1
