2754	Effects of dissolved @COMPOUND$ tension and agitation rate on the production of heat-shock protein @PROTEIN$ 96 by MethA tumor cell suspension culture in stirred-tank bioreactors.	0
2755	Reactive oxygen species induce phosphorylation of @COMPOUND$ 118 and 167 on @PROTEIN$ alpha.	1
2756	Both kinases have been implicated in the phosphorylation of @COMPOUND$ 118 and serine 167 on @PROTEIN$, respectively.	1
2757	Our data show for the first time that ROS can induce post-translational modifications of @PROTEIN$ at @COMPOUND$ 118 and serine 167, and may lead to ERalpha down-regulation in human breast cancer cells.	1
2758	Reactivity of @COMPOUND$ with the (4Fe-4S) cluster of @PROTEIN$ from Escherichia coli.	1
2759	The rate constant for the initial reaction between NO and the @PROTEIN$ (@COMPOUND$ is estimated to be (7.0+/-2.0)x10(6) M(-2) x s(-1) at 25 degrees C, which is approx.	1
2760	These results suggest that @PROTEIN$ delivers @COMPOUND$ to mitochondria where regulatory oxysterols are generated.	1
2761	@PROTEIN$ promoter hypermethylation correlates with a survival benefit from @COMPOUND$ in patients with recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma but not glioblastoma.	1
