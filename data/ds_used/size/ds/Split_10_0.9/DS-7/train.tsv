Changes in @COMPOUND$ consumption and the RQ ratio during sedentary and low-intensity exercise were not different between alpha(1)-@PROTEIN$-DN and WT.	0
Goldfish scales were incubated either with 20:3n-9 or with @COMPOUND$ at 15 degrees C for 6 and 18 h. Both osteoblastic and osteoclastic activities in the scale were assessed by measuring alkaline phosphatase (@PROTEIN$) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, respectively.	0
Goldfish scales were incubated either with 20:3n-9 or with @COMPOUND$ at 15 degrees C for 6 and 18 h. Both osteoblastic and osteoclastic activities in the scale were assessed by measuring @PROTEIN$ (ALP) and tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase, respectively.	0
These results suggest that @PROTEIN$ delivers @COMPOUND$ to mitochondria where regulatory oxysterols are generated.	1
Adenosine nucleotide translocase (@PROTEIN$) translocates ADP/@COMPOUND$ across the inner mitochondrial membrane.	1
Glucocorticoid-activated GR repressed @PROTEIN$ gene induction by @COMPOUND$ (LPS).	1
@COMPOUND$ dinucleotides identified in Bhlhb2, Pparg, @PROTEIN$, and Egr1 binding sites at the Prkce gene promoter were densely methylated in males and females and were unaffected by cocaine exposure.	1
@COMPOUND$ dinucleotides identified in Bhlhb2, @PROTEIN$, E2f, and Egr1 binding sites at the Prkce gene promoter were densely methylated in males and females and were unaffected by cocaine exposure.	1
