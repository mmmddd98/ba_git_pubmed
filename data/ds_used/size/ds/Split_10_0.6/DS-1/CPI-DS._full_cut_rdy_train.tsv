Using immunocytochemistry and Western blot analysis, we found that the activation of @PROTEIN$/2 due to hsBAFF was triggered by a (@COMPOUND$+))(i)-dependent pathway, leading to elevation of B cell proliferation.	1
This is supported by the findings that intracellular Ca(2+) chelator @COMPOUND$ attenuated phosphorylated @PROTEIN$/2 expression and cell proliferation in hsBAFF-stimulated B cells.	1
Taken together, the main finding of this study is that hsBAFF elicits higher but homeostatic (@COMPOUND$+))(i) levels, which regulates @PROTEIN$/2 activity and cell proliferation in in vitro B cells.	1
