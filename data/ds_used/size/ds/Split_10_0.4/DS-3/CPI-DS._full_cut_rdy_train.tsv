The data provide the first demonstration for the presence of @PROTEIN$ in primary cilia of renal epithelial cells, and a functional @COMPOUND$-signaling pathway, which targets ciliary channel function and may help control the sensory function of the primary cilium.	0
The purpose of this research was to enhance intranasal drug targeting to the CNS by incorporating a vasoconstrictor (phenylephrine (PHE)) into nasal formulations containing therapeutic @PROTEIN$ (hypocretin-1 (HC) or the dipeptide L-Tyr-D-Arg (D-@COMPOUND$)).	0
The purpose of this research was to enhance intranasal drug targeting to the CNS by incorporating a vasoconstrictor (phenylephrine (PHE)) into nasal formulations containing therapeutic neuropeptides (@PROTEIN$ (HC) or the dipeptide L-Tyr-D-Arg (D-@COMPOUND$)).	0
@COMPOUND$ dinucleotides identified in Bhlhb2, Pparg, @PROTEIN$, and Egr1 binding sites at the Prkce gene promoter were densely methylated in males and females and were unaffected by cocaine exposure.	1
