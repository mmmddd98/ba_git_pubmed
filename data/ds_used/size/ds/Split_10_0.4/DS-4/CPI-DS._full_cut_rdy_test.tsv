2231	Acylcarnitines have been suggested to play a role in @PROTEIN$ resistance, as well as other @COMPOUND$ metabolites.	0
2232	In the present study we investigated whether muscle long-chain acylcarnitines increase during fasting and we investigated their relationship with @COMPOUND$/fat oxidation and @PROTEIN$ sensitivity in lean healthy humans.	0
2233	17beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (@PROTEIN$) is a key enzyme of @COMPOUND$ biosynthesis, which might play an important role in follicular development of the ovary.	1
2234	@PROTEIN$ (HSD17B1) is a key enzyme of @COMPOUND$ biosynthesis, which might play an important role in follicular development of the ovary.	1
2235	This review will focus on recent evidence that @COMPOUND$, @PROTEIN$ and neuropeptide Y act by converging on neuronal cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathways to alter the autonomic phenotype in both health and disease.	1
2236	This review will focus on recent evidence that @COMPOUND$, natriuretic peptides and @PROTEIN$ act by converging on neuronal cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathways to alter the autonomic phenotype in both health and disease.	1
2237	Deletion of the first @COMPOUND$-rich region of the varicella-zoster virus @PROTEIN$ ectodomain abolishes the gE and gI interaction and differentially affects cell-cell spread and viral entry.	1
2238	Glucocorticoid-activated GR repressed @PROTEIN$ gene induction by @COMPOUND$ (LPS).	1
2239	The purpose of this research was to enhance intranasal drug targeting to the CNS by incorporating a vasoconstrictor (phenylephrine (PHE)) into nasal formulations containing therapeutic @PROTEIN$ (hypocretin-1 (HC) or the dipeptide L-Tyr-D-Arg (D-@COMPOUND$)).	0
