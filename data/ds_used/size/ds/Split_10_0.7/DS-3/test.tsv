3883	In the present study we investigated whether muscle long-chain acylcarnitines increase during fasting and we investigated their relationship with @COMPOUND$/fat oxidation and @PROTEIN$ sensitivity in lean healthy humans.	0
3884	These results suggest that @PROTEIN$ delivers @COMPOUND$ to mitochondria where regulatory oxysterols are generated.	1
3885	17beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (@PROTEIN$) is a key enzyme of @COMPOUND$ biosynthesis, which might play an important role in follicular development of the ovary.	1
3886	@PROTEIN$ (HSD17B1) is a key enzyme of @COMPOUND$ biosynthesis, which might play an important role in follicular development of the ovary.	1
3887	To investigate the correlation between O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (@PROTEIN$) promoter methylation and benefit from @COMPOUND$ in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma.	1
3888	@COMPOUND$ binding to human @PROTEIN$ : a study of protein conformation and binding affinity.	1
3889	Adenosine nucleotide translocase (@PROTEIN$) translocates ADP/@COMPOUND$ across the inner mitochondrial membrane.	1
3890	Deletion of the first @COMPOUND$-rich region of the varicella-zoster virus @PROTEIN$ ectodomain abolishes the gE and gI interaction and differentially affects cell-cell spread and viral entry.	1
3891	Glucocorticoid-activated GR repressed @PROTEIN$ gene induction by @COMPOUND$ (LPS).	1
3892	Inhibition of P-@PROTEIN$-mediated @COMPOUND$ resistance by reversibly linked quinine homodimers.	1
3893	The data provide the first demonstration for the presence of @PROTEIN$ in primary cilia of renal epithelial cells, and a functional @COMPOUND$-signaling pathway, which targets ciliary channel function and may help control the sensory function of the primary cilium.	0
3894	The endothelial (Ca(2+))(@COMPOUND$) response to @PROTEIN$ (100 nM) was significantly attenuated.	1
3895	The endothelial (@COMPOUND$+))(CYT) response to @PROTEIN$ (100 nM) was significantly attenuated.	1
3896	The purpose of this research was to enhance intranasal drug targeting to the CNS by incorporating a vasoconstrictor (phenylephrine (PHE)) into nasal formulations containing therapeutic @PROTEIN$ (hypocretin-1 (HC) or the dipeptide L-Tyr-D-Arg (D-@COMPOUND$)).	0
