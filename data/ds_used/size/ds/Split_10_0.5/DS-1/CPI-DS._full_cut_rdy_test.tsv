2787	Acylcarnitines have been suggested to play a role in @PROTEIN$ resistance, as well as other @COMPOUND$ metabolites.	0
2788	In the present study we investigated whether muscle long-chain acylcarnitines increase during fasting and we investigated their relationship with @COMPOUND$/fat oxidation and @PROTEIN$ sensitivity in lean healthy humans.	0
2789	17beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (@PROTEIN$) is a key enzyme of @COMPOUND$ biosynthesis, which might play an important role in follicular development of the ovary.	1
2790	@PROTEIN$ (HSD17B1) is a key enzyme of @COMPOUND$ biosynthesis, which might play an important role in follicular development of the ovary.	1
2791	@COMPOUND$ binding to human @PROTEIN$ : a study of protein conformation and binding affinity.	1
2792	Adenosine nucleotide translocase (@PROTEIN$) translocates ADP/@COMPOUND$ across the inner mitochondrial membrane.	1
