Reactivity of @COMPOUND$ with the (4Fe-4S) cluster of @PROTEIN$ from Escherichia coli.	1
The rate constant for the initial reaction between NO and the @PROTEIN$ (@COMPOUND$ is estimated to be (7.0+/-2.0)x10(6) M(-2) x s(-1) at 25 degrees C, which is approx.	1
@COMPOUND$ attenuates the HFS-induced, @PROTEIN$-mediated LTP in a dose-dependent manner in rat striatum.	1
These results suggest that @PROTEIN$ delivers @COMPOUND$ to mitochondria where regulatory oxysterols are generated.	1
@PROTEIN$ promoter hypermethylation correlates with a survival benefit from @COMPOUND$ in patients with recurrent anaplastic astrocytoma but not glioblastoma.	1
To investigate the correlation between O(6)-methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (@PROTEIN$) promoter methylation and benefit from @COMPOUND$ in patients with recurrent high-grade glioma.	1
This review will focus on recent evidence that @COMPOUND$, @PROTEIN$ and neuropeptide Y act by converging on neuronal cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathways to alter the autonomic phenotype in both health and disease.	1
