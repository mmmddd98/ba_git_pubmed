2781	17beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (@PROTEIN$) is a key enzyme of @COMPOUND$ biosynthesis, which might play an important role in follicular development of the ovary.	1
2782	@PROTEIN$ (HSD17B1) is a key enzyme of @COMPOUND$ biosynthesis, which might play an important role in follicular development of the ovary.	1
2783	Adenosine nucleotide translocase (@PROTEIN$) translocates ADP/@COMPOUND$ across the inner mitochondrial membrane.	1
2784	This review will focus on recent evidence that @COMPOUND$, @PROTEIN$ and neuropeptide Y act by converging on neuronal cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathways to alter the autonomic phenotype in both health and disease.	1
2785	This review will focus on recent evidence that @COMPOUND$, natriuretic peptides and @PROTEIN$ act by converging on neuronal cyclic nucleotide-dependent pathways to alter the autonomic phenotype in both health and disease.	1
2786	Glucocorticoid-activated GR repressed @PROTEIN$ gene induction by @COMPOUND$ (LPS).	1
2787	Inhibition of P-@PROTEIN$-mediated @COMPOUND$ resistance by reversibly linked quinine homodimers.	1
2788	The endothelial (Ca(2+))(@COMPOUND$) response to @PROTEIN$ (100 nM) was significantly attenuated.	1
2789	The endothelial (@COMPOUND$+))(CYT) response to @PROTEIN$ (100 nM) was significantly attenuated.	1
2790	The purpose of this research was to enhance intranasal drug targeting to the CNS by incorporating a vasoconstrictor (phenylephrine (PHE)) into nasal formulations containing therapeutic @PROTEIN$ (hypocretin-1 (HC) or the dipeptide L-Tyr-D-Arg (D-@COMPOUND$)).	0
