524	Palmitate phosphorylated p38 and @PROTEIN$ kinases, and blocking of these kinases with specific inhibitors diminished the @COMPOUND$-induced cytokine secretion.	1
525	@COMPOUND$ also activated the @PROTEIN$ (c-Jun) transcription factor.	1
526	Macrophages isolated from iron deficient rats, or pregnant rats at day 21 of gestation, either supplemented with a single dose of @COMPOUND$, 10 mg, at the commencement of pregnancy, or not, showed significant increases of macrophage ferroportin mRNA expression, which was paralleled by significant decreases in hepatic @PROTEIN$ mRNA expression.	1
527	In addition, SAH caused large increases in markers of inflammation, including @PROTEIN$ and NFkappaB, and markers of cell injury or cell death, including IgG endocytosis and caspase-3 activation, with @COMPOUND$ significantly reducing these effects.	1
528	We conclude that block of @PROTEIN$ by @COMPOUND$ may ameliorate several pathologic effects associated with inflammation that lead to cortical dysfunction after SAH.	1
529	It is suggested that @COMPOUND$ acting through the GABA(A) receptor mechanism on the expression of GnRH gene and @PROTEIN$ gene in the hypothalamus may be involved in two processes: the biosynthesis of GnRH and the release of this neurohormone in the hypothalamus.	1
530	It is suggested that @COMPOUND$ acting through the GABA(A) receptor mechanism on the expression of @PROTEIN$ gene and GnRH-R gene in the hypothalamus may be involved in two processes: the biosynthesis of GnRH and the release of this neurohormone in the hypothalamus.	1
531	It is suggested that @COMPOUND$ acting through the @PROTEIN$ mechanism on the expression of GnRH gene and GnRH-R gene in the hypothalamus may be involved in two processes: the biosynthesis of GnRH and the release of this neurohormone in the hypothalamus.	1
532	It decreased TG levels in tyloxapol-induced hyperlipidemia and increased @PROTEIN$ @COMPOUND$ (HDL-C) and reduced atherogenic index in normotensive rats.	1
533	Associated with the mitochondrial permeabilization, PdC also induced the release of @PROTEIN$, which is sensitive to inhibition by @COMPOUND$.	1
534	Here we show that @PROTEIN$ selectively increases the power of @COMPOUND$-induced, but not carbachol-induced, gamma oscillations in acute hippocampal slices.	1
535	Here we show that @PROTEIN$ selectively increases the power of kainate-induced, but not @COMPOUND$-induced, gamma oscillations in acute hippocampal slices.	0
536	These effects of @PROTEIN$beta are blocked by @COMPOUND$, a pan-specific antagonist of ErbB receptors, and are mediated specifically via ErbB4 receptors, because mice harboring a targeted mutation of ErbB4 do not respond to NRG-1.	1
537	@COMPOUND$ increased the levels of CD95 (@PROTEIN$), CD95-ligand and Fas-associated death domain.	1
538	@COMPOUND$ inhibits serum amyloid a-induced @PROTEIN$ expression in human endothelial cells.	1
539	@COMPOUND$ treatment significantly attenuated TNF-alpha, IL-6, and @PROTEIN$ 6 h after CLP.	1
540	@COMPOUND$ treatment significantly attenuated TNF-alpha, @PROTEIN$, and IL-1beta 6 h after CLP.	1
541	@COMPOUND$ treatment significantly attenuated @PROTEIN$, IL-6, and IL-1beta 6 h after CLP.	1
542	Atypical sialylated N-@COMPOUND$ structures are attached to neuronal @PROTEIN$.	1
543	@COMPOUND$ linkages were identified for @PROTEIN$, Kv3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 1.1, 1.2 and 1.4, by evaluating their electrophoretic migration patterns in adult rat brain membranes digested with various glycosidases.	1
544	Total plasma @COMPOUND$ level, @PROTEIN$ C677T polymorphism, inherited abnormalities of the natural anticoagulant system as well as plasma folate and cobalamin levels were determined.	0
545	Total plasma homocysteine level, @PROTEIN$ C677T polymorphism, inherited abnormalities of the natural anticoagulant system as well as plasma folate and @COMPOUND$ levels were determined.	0
546	Total plasma homocysteine level, @PROTEIN$ C677T polymorphism, inherited abnormalities of the natural anticoagulant system as well as plasma @COMPOUND$ and cobalamin levels were determined.	0
547	This was significantly in accordance with intracellular oxidative stress levels measured by glutathione depletion, @COMPOUND$ production, @PROTEIN$ inhibition as well as reactive oxygen species generation.	0
548	This was significantly in accordance with intracellular oxidative stress levels measured by glutathione depletion, malondialdehyde production, @PROTEIN$ inhibition as well as reactive @COMPOUND$ species generation.	0
549	This was significantly in accordance with intracellular oxidative stress levels measured by @COMPOUND$ depletion, malondialdehyde production, @PROTEIN$ inhibition as well as reactive oxygen species generation.	0
